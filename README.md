Hi! My name is ECP and this is my first GitHub repository

About me:
I am a human being (or so I've been led to believe) and I live on planet Earth (or so I've been told). Whatever I am, and wherever I happen to be, I will always be me. If someone were to tell me "dear sir, you think therefors you are" I would kindly respond with a smile and an augmentation of thier original statement, saying "kind fellow, you are not wrong but I think I am right to tell you nay... while I do indeed think and I certainly am... it is best to bestow my being with a better befitting branding... so let me be the to help ye see... that for I... I am, therefore I think..."
